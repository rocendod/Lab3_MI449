<h1> &gt; About Me </h1>
<h2>This page is about me, Aurora Lunaris born in Florida. I have always loved to play soccer. I would even play it during my exploration although it is not as fun when the ball is stuck in the air for a while. But I was always fascinated by the rockets that fly into the sky and slowing disappear as the rocket distance increase from Earth surface. This inspire me to become a scientist and learn about the earth and space. As the world started to develop and space travel became more accessible, I had the opportunity to travel in a ship to discover the surface of different planets, which I gladly accept as this was my dream. I do miss my parents at home, but I hope they are doing well and that what I discover in my adventure can help create a better world or worlds.</h2>
