<h2>Hi, this is Aurora and today is August 03, 2024, and we are located in Proxima Centauri b or Proxima for short. It’ been two weeks since I have been here and to be honest this planet is amazing; we are able to breath without our suits and the color of the sky of planet is different from Earth’s blue sky. There are also mass bodies of water located in this exoplanet and there is still more to discover as we keep exploring. There still has not been any sign of life other than ours, but we have gathered some mineral sample and I think we may have found something interesting we will keep analyzing it. For the rest of today I will look outside after this long day and admire the red sunset of Proxima on the horizon.</h2>
