<h1> &gt; June 21 2043 Log </h1>
<h2>Hello, this is Aurora and today is June 21, 2024, location Europa. It has been two days since we first landed, my team have finished setting up the housing and the lab to begin our research. We are required to wear our suits outside still since the atmosphere is not suitable for us to breath, but inside our housing we are able to take them off. The technology for the housing is really incredible and I am thankful to our engineers back on Earth. Gravity in Europa is less them Earth gravity and I am able to jump it bit higher. When we first got on the ship I almost trip down the stairs since the gravity was different, but a good thing Estellar was there to grab before that happened. Tomorrow we should grab samples of minerals to the north of the housing, this should be interesting.</h2>
